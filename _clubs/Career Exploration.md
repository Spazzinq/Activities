Joining the Career Exploration Club has many benefits:
- Learn about different jobs. 
- Meet interesting career professionals and have the opportunity to get your questions answered directly from someone working in the field.
- Consider how different careers might fit for your future plans and goals.
- Get involved with a club during the school day. As an added bonus, participating in a club such as this can count towards earning the Student Engagement Seal.

All WKHS students are invited to join the Career Exploration Club. During lunch periods, you can learn directly from guest speakers in a wide range of career fields. Presenters will share insights about their jobs to allow students to consider how various professions might fit for their own strengths and interests. In fact, learning which careers would NOT be a good fit, is also valuable information to help guide students when considering their future plans.

All students are invited to join the club presentations and learn about the different careers. Each presentation will take place during 1/2 of the lunch periods. For the spring of 2022, presentations will take place during the 2nd half of 5th period (12-12:20) and the first half of 6th period (12:25-12:45). Advance registration is not required. Students are encouraged to simply show up with a willingness to listen and an interest to learn from our guest speakers.
