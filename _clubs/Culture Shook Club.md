Mission: Culture Shook is a program in which students from WKHS meet students from other high schools in Ohio with a diverse range of backgrounds (urban, suburban, rural) to make friendships and develop a diverse worldview.  

Do you like to meet people, make friends, and hang out? Then Culture Shook is the program for you! This club is a low-key, fun way to visit other high schools throughout Ohio and make friends with some great students!  This is also a great way to broaden your horizons and learn about students from different parts of the state.   Learn more about our green goals [here](https://instagram.com/WKHS_ESC), or come to a meeting WHEN!
