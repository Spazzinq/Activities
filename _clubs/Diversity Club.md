If you're someone who wants to discuss issues and take positive action on topics that matter to you at WKHS and in your community, join Diversity Club! During Diversity Club meetings, we have honest and open conversations with each other about issues and situations regarding race in our school community/member's communities. We do this by starting each meeting with a discussion question, either brought up by one of our club leaders or picked from questions that members have asked.
