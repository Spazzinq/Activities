NHS was established in 1921 and over 1 million high school students are currently members of the organization which recognizes students for their excellence in scholarship, character, leadership and service to school and community. By supporting a strong and active NHS, Worthington Kilbourne seeks to elevate our commitment to these values and high student achievement and excellence.   

In order to be considered for induction into the National Honor Society at WKHS, a student must have:
- Attained junior or senior class standing;
- Achieved a cumulative unweighted grade point average of at least 3.5 for the Class of 2022, and 3.75 beginning with the Class of 2023;
- Attended Worthington Kilbourne High School for at least one semester;
- Demonstrated a commitment to serving our community through service experiences during high school, for a minimum of 10 hours;
- Demonstrated leadership qualities through experiences during high school.

Your GPA may make you eligible to apply for NHS, but submitting an application means that you will now be evaluated in the areas of character, leadership, and service. Some students with a high GPA might lack evidence in one of these areas and are surprised when they are not granted acceptance. NHS is intended to include students who have an exemplary academic record, AND strong character and leadership qualities, along with ample evidence of service to others.

After student applications are submitted, all school faculty will be invited to assist in the evaluation of a candidateâ€™s character. Then, a Faculty Selection Committee will review the information you provide on the application to evaluate your leadership qualities and service commitment. The Selection Committee considers this information blindly; your faculty character evaluation, and leadership and service examples are considered without the Committee knowing your identity. Following the evaluation process, you will receive an Email of Acceptance or an email of Denial. Once admitted, NHS members are expected to attend monthly meetings run by our student officers, and enthusiastically engage in service opportunities and projects planned by NHS. If you are not invited to join NHS as a junior, you may be invited to apply again, if eligible, when you are a senior.
