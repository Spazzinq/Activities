Are you interested in creative writing, but don't know where to start? Are you already a creative writer who wants feedback on your work? Panoply might be the right club for you! This club dedicated to *three things*: reading, creating, and workshopping. Whether you need a few ideas for your next novel, a refresher on how to write a compelling story, or even just the opportunity to discuss writing at a higher level, you can do it with Panoply. Come see what Panoply is all about on any Monday after school in Mr. Cecutti's room (Room 232)!
