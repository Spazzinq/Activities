Want to go on day long field trips to a pumpkin patch, movie, restuarant, mall and much more? Want to spend your day with students of all ages and needs on these field trips? Consider being a REACH member and work with our students in the Daily Living Skills rooms! There are many opportunities to spend time during the day in the rooms or to go on trips with us.
