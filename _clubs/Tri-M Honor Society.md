**Mission**: Tri-Mâ€™s mission is to inspire students to excel at music and leadership through service activities and other accomplishments.

If you want to help out your community through music-related activities or find a group of friends who have a shared interest for service and music, come join Tri-M! Plus, once you are a senior, you can get a pink chord for graduation as an award!

Tri-M is the music honors society at Kilbourne. Tri-M unites students who are interested in both service and music by providing them with opportunities to accomplish music-related service opportunities at Kilbourne as well as with a supporting group of friends. Some examples of these opportunities are aiding with the OIPA competition at Kilbourne and the yearly music wing cleanup. Tri-M also encourages participants to attend concerts outside of their home music department to encourage a greater connection between music departments at Kilbourne. In all, Tri-M brings together students from every aspect of music at Kilbourne and develops crucial leadership skills through fun and engaging volunteer opportunities.
