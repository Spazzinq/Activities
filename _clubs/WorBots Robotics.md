Are you hard-working and driven towards STEM? The WorBots bring everything from fabrication and programming, to business and graphic design, together to form a club that competes in international competitions across the Midwest in an effort to better connect students with their future. Students work with mentors from every industry to compete in the yearly challenge of building a life-sized robot to the specifications of the FIRST Robotics Competition. Not only does the team construct, wire, and program the robot, but its members also fundraise, advertise, perform community service, and spread STEM throughout the Worthington community.
